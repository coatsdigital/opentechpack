## How to contribute

Open a new discussion item and pitch your idea. Explain the idea/problem and describe the content you want to see added to the documentation. 
Openly we'll discuss your proposal and find a way forward. We will try not spend a lot of time on a contribution that might be outside the scope of the overall concept.
