This is a community effort to create an Open TechPack file format for creating, reading, and enriching information used in the production of garments in the fashion industry.

Head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/coatsdigital/opentechpack/discussions) to contribute.

## Current challenges with TechPacks
- There is no standard. A manufacturer could receive lots of different TechPacks in various formats and has to build up skills for each variation.

## Goals
- TechPacks need to be both human and machine-readable
