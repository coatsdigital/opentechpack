# Open TechPack

![](/OpenTechPack.png)

This is a community effort to create an Open Tech Pack file format for creating, reading, and enriching Tech Packs in the Fashion and garment industry.

Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/coatsdigital/opentechpack/issues) to contribute.

## Current challenges with TechPacks
- There is no standard. A manufacturer could receive lots of different TechPacks in various formats and has to build up skills for each variation.

## Goals
- TechPacks need to be both human and machine-readable
